##  About Me
I am a Physics-educated Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience turning messy, unstructured data into clear product strategies.

Currently, I work at **Nationwide Insurance**, building internal AI tools and defining risk metrics. Previously, I solved retention problems at **The Ohio State University**. My sweet spot is the intersection of **Product Analytics** (A/B testing, metric definition) and **AI Engineering** (building RAG agents and analyzing their performance).

I don't just build models; I build the logic that helps businesses make better decisions.

##  Featured Projects

### [1. The "North Star" Metric Decomposition (WhatsApp Clone)](link_to_project_repo_later)
*Status: In Progress*
**The Problem:** A messaging app saw signups rise but retention fall. Stakeholders didn't know why.
**The Solution:**
* Built a synthetic dataset simulating 10,000 users with a retention "drift" on Android devices.
* Designed a **Streamlit Dashboard** allowing PMs to toggle between inputs (New Users vs. Retained vs. Resurrected).
* **Outcome:** Identified that a specific update caused a 15% drop in Day-1 retention for Android users.
* *Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, Pandas.*

### [2. Analytics for AI Agents: Beyond Accuracy](link_to_project_repo_later)
*Status: In Progress*
**The Problem:** Most companies build AI bots but don't know if users actually like them.
**The Solution:**
* Built a RAG-based "Financial Q&A Bot" using LlamaIndex.
* Engineered a custom logging layer to capture latency, sentiment, and refusal rates.
* **Outcome:** Discovered that "Response Latency" > 3 seconds correlated with a 40% drop in user session length.
* *Tech Stack: LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Python, Plotly.*
